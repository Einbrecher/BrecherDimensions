# Brecher's Exploration Dimensions

A Minecraft mod that creates a temporary set of Exploration Dimensions that automatically reset/refresh with a new generation seed at each server restart. This system ensures that Players consistently have access to "new," untouched world generation - whether it be to experience new features/updates, explore pristine POIs, ravage the landscape for resources, or go mining - without the downsides of ballooning world file sizes or the need to constantly prune chunks. Players can access the Exploration Dimensions via slash commands, and any stragglers are automatically evacuated when the dimensions cycle. 

This mod looks to solve the problems server operators face when setting world borders or managing world size while also trying to give players enough room to explore. It uses mixins to override Minecraft's native restrictions when it comes to world seeds, so each successive Exploration Dimension truly is different from the last. Some basic popular mod compatibility (Xaero's, Corpse/Gravestone mods, Nature's/Exploration Compasses) is already built in, with more on the way.

## Features

- **Runtime Dimension Creation**: Dynamically creates "exploration" variants of existing dimensions (e.g., Overworld, Nether, End) at server startup
- **Daily Reset System**: Exploration Dimensions reset/refresh with new world generation seeds each server restart - Normal dimensions are unaffected
- **Slash Command Access**: Players can teleport to/from Exploration Dimensions using slash commands
- **Performance Optimized**: Aggressive chunk unloading and memory management for server stability
- **Inventory Preservation**: Optional keepInventory feature for players in Exploration Dimensions
- **Corpse Mod Compatibility**: Options to cede priority to or override popular corpse mod/gravestone mods with the keepInventory feature
- **Xaero Map Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of map data for old Exploration Dimensions

## Installation

1. Ensure you have Minecraft 1.21.1 with either:
   - Fabric Loader 0.16.9+ and Fabric API
   - NeoForge 21.1.162+
2. Download the appropriate mod JAR file from the releases page:
   - `brecher_dim-fabric-{version}-1.21.1.jar` for Fabric
   - `brecher_dim-neoforge-{version}-1.21.1.jar` for NeoForge
3. Place it in your mods folder
4. Configure the mod:
   - Fabric: `config/brecher_exploration.properties`
   - NeoForge: `config/brecher_dim-common.toml`

## Configuration

### Core Settings
- `enabledDimensions` - List of dimensions to create exploration copies for
- `explorationBorder` - World border size for Exploration Dimensions (-1 for same as parent)
- `seedStrategy` - Seed generation strategy: "random", "date-based", or "debug"

### Optional Features
- `preventExplorationSpawnSetting` - Disable spawn setting in Exploration Dimensions (beds/anchors will still explode)
- `keepInventoryInExploration` - keepInventory when dying in Exploration Dimensions
- `deferToCorpseMods` - Let corpse mods handle death instead of built-in keepInventory
- `disableEnderChests` - Block ender chest access in Exploration Dimensions
- `clearInventoryOnReturn` - Clear inventory when returning from Exploration Dimensions
- `cleanupXaeroMapData` - Auto-cleanup Xaero minimap data on dimension reset

### Restrictions
- `teleportCooldown` - Cooldown between teleports (in seconds)
- `restrictToCurrentDimension` - Only allow teleport to exploration version of current dimension

### Performance
- `aggressiveChunkUnloading` - Enable aggressive chunk unloading
- `maxChunksPerPlayer` - Maximum chunks loaded per player
- `preventDiskSaves` - Don't save Exploration Dimension chunks to disk; chunks will reset when **unloaded** - not just at server reset (performance heavy)
- `preGenerateSpawnChunks` - Pre-generate spawn chunks on dimension creation
- `oldDimensionRetentionCount` - How many, if any, "old" Exploration Dimensions should be kept

## Mod Compatibility

### Built-in Compatibility
- Both the Nature's Compass and Explorer's Compass mods will work in Exploration Dimensions
- Xaero's Map cleanup of old/unavailable Exploration Dimensions
- Corpse/Gravestone mod priority options with built-in keepInventory system

### Tested/Known Compatibilities
- Explorations Dimensions should work as-is with any world generation or structure mods/packs that use vanilla's built-in systems for generation or structure placement
- Xaero's Map / Minimap
- Terralith
- Yung's Structures
- Cobblemon

### Known Issues / WIP
- Mods that utilize custom placement mechanics (e.g., AE2 Meteorites) do not (yet) recognize the updated world seeds for Exploration Dimensions, so these generations will not change from cycle to cycle
- Broader version/loader support
- Modded/datapack dimensions should theoretically work, but are as of yet untested
